The Tamagotchi Gesture: Designing Mobile Apps with Personality
In the ever-evolving world of mobile app development, design plays a pivotal role in creating successful and user-friendly applications. While efficiency and practicality are essential, there’s something to be said for injecting personality and charm into our digital companions. Enter the “Tamagotchi Gesture.”
What Is Mobile Application Design?
Mobile application design encompasses various disciplines such as user interface (UI) design, user experience (UX) design, interaction design, and visual design. The goal is to create an app that not only meets user needs but also reflects the branding and objectives of the app’s developer or organization1. But how can we make our apps stand out in a sea of homogeneity?
The Tamagotchi Phenomenon
Remember the Tamagotchi? That small, egg-shaped virtual pet that captured our hearts in the late 1990s and early 2000s? Inside that tiny device lived a creature we cared for from birth to death. Tamagotchis required attention, love, and detail to thrive. Neglect them, and they’d meet an untimely demise. Care for them well, and you’d witness their offspring or watch them grow old.
By 2010, over 76 million Tamagotchis had been sold worldwide. So, what made them so popular? It was more than just feeding and cleaning up after a digital pet. It was the emotional connection—the sense of responsibility and attachment—that kept users engaged. And that’s where the “Tamagotchi Gesture” comes into play.
The Tamagotchi Gesture: Bringing Humanity Back
In today’s automated world, where efficiency reigns supreme, we find ourselves surrounded by products and apps that blend seamlessly into the background. AI devices like Alexa and Google Home share similar designs, making it challenging for users to differentiate among them. Designers, however, are rethinking this approach.
The Tamagotchi Gesture encourages us to embrace imperfections, quirks, and even obsolescence in our designs. It’s about balancing usability with user experience, understanding that sometimes the most efficient features aren’t necessarily the best for creating an optimal experience. Here’s how we can apply it:
⦁	Personality Over Precision:
⦁	Rather than obsessing over pixel-perfect layouts, consider adding personality. Maybe your app’s loading animation has a playful twist or an unexpected sound effect. Users appreciate these delightful surprises.
⦁	Imperfect Efficiency:
⦁	Efficiency isn’t always the end goal. Sometimes, a slightly less efficient feature can enhance the overall experience. Think of it as the charming quirk that sets your app apart.
⦁	Attention and Detail:
⦁	Like caring for a Tamagotchi, some features may require extra attention. Maybe it’s an interactive tutorial or a hidden Easter egg. Users who invest time and effort will feel more connected.
⦁	Embracing Fragility:
⦁	In a world of robust algorithms, consider introducing a touch of fragility. Maybe your app occasionally stumbles or displays a whimsical error message. It humanizes the experience.
Balancing Charm and Usability
The Tamagotchi Gesture isn’t about sacrificing usability—it’s about enhancing it. Take Reddit, for example. Its bare-bones design and forum-style organization aren’t the most user-friendly, yet millions of user’s flocks to it daily. Why? Because Reddit has character. It’s imperfect, but that imperfection is part of its charm.
As designers, let’s infuse our apps with a touch of Tamagotchi magic. Let’s create experiences that resonate, surprise, and engage users beyond mere functions with the app.
